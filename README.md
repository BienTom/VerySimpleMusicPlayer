# VerySimpleMusicPlayer
Simple, provisional music player made as Console.Application. 

It prints on the console text imitations of sounds of different instruments, depending on genre of music that user choose. It allows to add tracks, choose from different music genres and saving list of songs to a .bin file (I  am working now at proper loading it from saved file).
